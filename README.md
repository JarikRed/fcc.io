FCC.io
======

What?
-----
A URL shortener for FCC ID queries.

Why?
----
I can never find the search form on the FCC site, so fcc.io should be easy
enough to remember.

How?
----
The URL scheme is simple:
https://fcc.io/<applicant id>/<product id>

Try these:
 * https://fcc.io/NPI
 * https://fcc.io/NPI/71646

ToDo
