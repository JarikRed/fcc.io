FCC.io
======

What?
-----
A URL shortener for FCC ID queries.

Why?
----
I can never find the search form on the FCC site, so fcc.io should be easy
enough to remember.

How?
----
The URL scheme is simple:
 - https://fcc.io/"applicant id"/"product id"

Try these:
 - https://fcc.io/NPI
 - https://fcc.io/NPI/71646
 - https://fcc.io/grantee/lego

ToDo
----
Other searches?
